<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Rizky Fauzan Hanif</h1>

A passionate Network Engineer with interests in Cloud Engineering and Cybersecurity, based in Sleman, Special Region of Yogyakarta. Currently, I am a student at SMK Negeri 2 Depok Sleman. I enjoy exploring and learning new technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, virtualization, BGP, VPNs, firewalls, traffic control, IPv6, and network security.

To deepen my knowledge, I have earned MikroTik Certified Network Associate (MTCNA), MikroTik Certified Traffic Control Engineer (MTCTCE), and IPv6 Sage by Hurricane Electric, as well as additional certifications in programming, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.

I care about infrastructure that is reliable, maintainable, and scalable.
